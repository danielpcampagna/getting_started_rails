# Tutorial: Getting Started with Ruby on Rails

The tutorial, provided by rubyonrails.org, at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

```
This guide is designed for beginners who want to get started with a Rails application from scratch. It does not assume that you have any prior experience with Rails.

Rails is a web application framework running on the Ruby programming language. If you have no prior experience with Ruby, you will find a very steep learning curve diving straight into Rails. There are several curated lists of online resources for learning Ruby:

    Official Ruby Programming Language website
    List of Free Programming Books

Be aware that some resources, while still excellent, cover versions of Ruby as old as 1.6, and commonly 1.8, and will not include some syntax that you will see in day-to-day development with Rails.
```

## requirements:

* Ruby version: `ruby 2.5.1`

* Rails version: `Rails 5.2.0`
